  Anything you put before the outlet will appear here
</p>

<router-outlet>
  <p>But you can also inject things into the content loaded by the router too!. Those also go before, but are parented differently for CSS rules</p>
</router-outlet>

<p>
  Things that go AFTER the outlet appear after the content loaded by it. Logical stuff!
